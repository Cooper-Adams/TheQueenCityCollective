# The Queen City Collective

Rebuilding The Queen City Collective in React.

This site was a past passion project that fell to the wayside in recent years. After giving it a good look over and realizing how atrocious the code looked, I decided it was time to revive it in React, which in my opinion is 100x better than EJS, which was used originally. For now I am translating the spaghetti code into react components/pages (and probably some Contexts) while separating and reducing the total CSS that was overwriting itself through many different pages. The end goal is to have a responsive website with articles available for users to comment on by signing up/in. I will also be able to write new articles as my login will have admin verification that is checked in the backend.
